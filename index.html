                Charity Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports poor children to live healthy life. We  bridge the gap between donors and NGOs who are involved in the same cause. Charity Foundation founded during pandemic when the poor families  were struggling for a time meal.

                "Aim of Charity Fundation is to make India free from malnutrition and to contibute in making India a world leader full of healthy minds. Charity Foundation wishes to through out the devil of misery and illness from every corner of India and to make highly nutritious “ready-to-use food” products more accessible and affordable to those who need them most, while also increasing awareness of their benefits and therefore generating demand."
                <br>
                we want to fight malnutrition before it occurs. If undernutrition occurs during the first 1000 days, it creates irreversible damages even if it’s treated afterward. So, we empower mothers to act preventively and have a real community-level impact on poverty.
